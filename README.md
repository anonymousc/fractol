# Mandelbrot Set Visualization using MLX

## Introduction
This project aims to visualize the famous Mandelbrot set using the MLX library in C. The Mandelbrot set is a set of complex numbers for which the function \( f_c(z) = z^2 + c \) does not diverge when iterated from \( z = 0 \), i.e., the sequence \( f_c(0), f_c(f_c(0)), f_c(f_c(f_c(0))), \ldots \) remains bounded.

## About Mandelbrot Set Is the Main one
The Mandelbrot set is named after the mathematician Beno√Æt B. Mandelbrot, who studied it in the 1970s and 1980s. It is perhaps the most famous example of a fractal - a mathematical object that displays self-similar patterns at every scale.

## About MLX
MLX is a simple graphics library in C primarily used for creating graphical user interfaces in UNIX-based systems. It provides basic functionalities for rendering graphics, such as drawing points, lines, and shapes on the screen.

## Getting Started
To run the Mandelbrot set visualization:

1. Make sure you have MLX installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository.
3. Compile the code using the provided Makefile.
4. Run the executable.

## Usage
The program allows you to navigate and zoom into different regions of the Mandelbrot set using mouse clicks and keyboard inputs.

- Use arrow keys to move the viewport.
- Use mouse scroll to zoom in/out.
- Press 'ESC' to exit the program.

## Dependencies
- MLX library
- Z suit for the formula (Zn+1 = Z^2 + c)
- 42 docs
